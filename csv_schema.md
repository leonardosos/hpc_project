# MPI Timing Results CSV Schema

This document describes the schema for the `mpi_timing_results.csv` file that stores performance timing data from MPI parallel computing experiments.

## File Structure

- **Filename**: `mpi_timing_results.csv`
- **Format**: Comma-separated values (CSV)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Header**: Yes (automatically added when file is first created)

## Schema Fields

| Field Name | Data Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `timestamp` | String | Date and time when the experiment was run | `2025-06-23 14:30:45` |
| `processes` | Integer | Number of MPI processes used in the experiment | `4` |
| `grid_rows` | Integer | Number of rows in the computational grid | `100` |
| `grid_cols` | Integer | Number of columns in the computational grid | `100` |
| `execution_time` | Float | Total execution time in seconds (5 decimal precision) | `12.34567` |

## Field Details

### timestamp

- **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
- **Purpose**: Records when each experiment was executed
- **Generated by**: `datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")`

### processes

- **Source**: MPI world size (`world_size`)
- **Purpose**: Tracks scaling behavior across different process counts
- **Range**: Positive integers (typically powers of 2 in HPC contexts)

### grid_rows / grid_cols

- **Source**: Grid dimensions array (`dims[0]` and `dims[1]`)
- **Purpose**: Records the problem size for performance analysis
- **Range**: Positive integers

### execution_time

- **Format**: Floating-point number with 5 decimal places
- **Units**: Seconds
- **Purpose**: Primary performance metric for timing analysis
- **Precision**: Microsecond-level accuracy

```

## Usage Notes

- File is created automatically on first run
- Data is appended to existing file on subsequent runs
- Only rank 0 process writes to the file (prevents duplicate entries)
- Suitable for performance scaling studies
